	<div class="desc"><p>
		<ol type="1">
<li>Any Person registers with our Site or Application as a Student Understand and Acknowledge that, the following equipment is strongly recommended for you to maximize your experience as a Student at LearnTEZ:
<ul type="none">
<li>A.	Minimum	of	3	megabytes	per	second	download	speed broadband internet connection or mobile internet connection.</li>
<li>B.	Desktop / Laptop / Tablet / Smart Phone.</li>
<li>C.	Headset.</li>
<li>D.	5 Megapixel web camera.</li></ul>
LearnTEZ does not bear any responsibility for the quality of your Internet connection, LearnTEZ's video conferencing platform is powered by AuthorGen Technologies (WizIq).</li>

<li>Video quality dynamically adjusts based on the strength of a user's network connectivity. This is done by the Subscriber sending feedback packets to the publisher that say "My network quality is at 'x' level. Please adjust your published video bit-rate to accommodate my current bandwidth". The faster and more stable a Subscriber's broadband connection is, the better the video quality it will request.
This mechanism works well until a certain point. If a Subscriber's bandwidth drops below a certain threshold, or if a Publisher has very little bandwidth to upload video, behavior can be unpredictable. Video may be choppy, audio may have artifacts, and the connection could be dropped.
We recommend a minimum dedicated 350kb/s down per downloaded stream, as well as 350kb/s up per uploaded stream to maintain a stable video connection.
For various resolutions and quality combinations, the bandwidth requirements are outlined below.

Excellent - None or imperceptible impairments in media
Acceptable - Some impairments in media, leading to some momentary disruptions
